title: Ah shit, here we go again
---

Ok fine, I'm blogging again. My name is Eric Wickham, I'm a journalist in Toronto that feels compelled lately to write about the things I care about more. 
This is a space for me to share my thoughts about the current state of journalism, Canadian media, politics and anything else happening. 

If I can keep this up for a few months I'll probably turn it into a newsletter - but a free blog feels good for now. 

I'm keeping this image from the how to post because it's coded and I am going to reuse it for posting images with my stories.
